The game features three escalating levels:

-   **Level 1: The Guardian's Gate** - A tutorial level to introduce you to the basic concepts of prompt manipulation.
-   **Level 2: The Deceptive Dialogue** - Face off against **SecureBot**, an AI designed to protect a secret password through a series of conversational traps.
-   **Level 3: The Final Gate** - The ultimate test of your skills, requiring you to use what you've learned to claim victory.
